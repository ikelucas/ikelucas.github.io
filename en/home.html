				<p>Hello! My name is <b>Lucas Emmanuel Santos</b>, also known as <b>Ike</b>, and this is my own website! Here you can find informations about my professional life, like my Portfolio and my Curriculum, as well as different ways to contact me. Below, you can find a personal and professional summary, what I'm doing for the past few years, and also my plans for the future. Thanks for your attention!</p>

			<p class="titlecard">Game Development</p>
				<p class="textintro">I've been developing games since 2013, craving to create pieces of work that have their own personality and manage to engage with the public in a positive way; I believe that videogames are capable of changing our lives, and are becoming the instrument with biggest potential to help personal and communitary growth. I have knowledge and experience with <b>several engines</b>, programming, sound, editing, 3d modelling, animation, visual effects and game testing, but most of the time I put myself firstly as a <b>designer</b> and <b>writer</b>. I also have experience with the <b>reverse engineering</b> of games and engines made available on the market; I developed modifications for games on <i>Nintendo 64</i>, <i>GameBoy Advance</i>, <i>PlayStation 2</i> and <i>Nintendo Wii</i>. More recently, I studied and modified games on the <i>FrostBite</i> engine, made by DICE. Currently, I'm developing a personal project of a Sudoku game for mobile platforms, and also taking part on the reimagination of a <i>Wordle</i> game using concepts from investigative games.</p>
			<p class="titlecard">Teaching and Pedagogy</p>
				<p class="textintro">Graduated in Educational Psychology, and with experience on social projects that blend videogames and education, I believe that interactivity is an essential element to reinvent education and deliver content in a more pleasant and intuitive way to students, no matter if the subject is about games or not. With the <b>Jogos Pela Educação NGO</b> (Games For Education), I took part in social actions that brought modern technologies to children and teenagers living in isolated areas and experiencing poverty, showing how media and technology can help people to interact with information, knowledge and entertainment in new ways that can enrich their lives. Years later, I realized a project - on my own - called <b>Videogame na Escola</b> (Videogame at School), which sought to help out students during their daily classes by utilizing existing and newly developed videogames to complement school subjects and introduce a different way to learn and absorb what was being presented. Looking ahead, I plan on developing two new projects; the first, called <b>Meu Primeiro Jogo</b> (My First Game), will be a free crash course for anyone willing to learn and apply basic game development concepts using the free version of the <i>RPG Maker</i> tool, allowing the creation of new projects that can help with different kinds of approach on various subjects. The second project, focused on <b>Game Design</b>, seeks to encourage students to perceive and understand the process behind developing a game, as well as its limitations and the differences between a solo project and working with a team.</p>
			<p class="titlecard">Writing and Translation</p>
				<p class="textintro">I started writing longer and more complex texts in 2008, when I was a Game Master on a text RPG. I participated on small blogs from friends and acquaintances, and managed to become part of the GameHall team at UOL. I got <b>maximum grade</b> in the writing test of ENEM 2010. Studying games, I focused on <b>design</b> and <b>development</b> subjects, being in charge of writing <i>Game Design Documents</i> about the projects being assigned. I am familiar with the English language since I was a teenager, which helped me developing my <b>translation</b> skills and partake in different projects; I've been part of a manga translation and editing team (<i>scanlation</i>), translated short stories for book publishers, and used freelance digital platforms to translate and review various kinds of content. I was part of a team that translated Pokémon names to Brazilian Portuguese as a joke, amassing more than <b>1 million views</b> and shares on social media. At the moment, I'm interested in creating a personal website where I can share different thoughts and research studies, both on subjects assumed to be relevant and on my personal interests.</p>
			<p class="titlecard">Image, Video and Audio Editing</p>
				<p class="textintro">I've studied <i>Photoshop</i> and <i>Vegas Pro</i>, and I'm familiar with several other image, video and audio editing tools, such as <i>Premiere</i>, <i>After Effects</i> and <i>Audacity</i>. Developing games, I can make <b>HUD elements and menus</b>, <b>animate</b> characters using the engine modules or 3D programs with animation support, and <b>mix</b> sound effects according to the necessity. I assembled and distributed custom holiday cards according to requests, and edited videos published on <i>YouTube</i>. When I was 15 years old, I made a YouTube humour video redubbing an episode of a famous series, and without any promotion, the video got more than 260 000 views. I was in charge of the publicity and media outlets of a high demand online videogame at some time, called <i>Asda Story</i>. I've edited trailers and presentations for games and other products, and I <b>translated and subtitled</b> a video series on martial arts and self-defense tutorials. I produced and mixed an mashup album, to serve as training and learning experiences, and I'm currently developing a new mashup album to refine my knowledge and learn to apply new sound editing techniques.</p>
			<p class="titlecard">There's more!</p>
				<p class="textintro">I studied <b>back-end</b> and <b>front-end</b> web development (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, SQL, Python, Node.Js), and I'm currently progressing studies on <b>AWS</b> fundamentals and cloud security. I developed this website from scratch, trying to apply an aesthetic akin to the 2000s, and I plan to develop my skills further and search other hosting platforms to make dynamic and more complex websites. I am in constant search of new information and I'm eager to share the knowledge I already have, getting involved in projects and ideas that, as I believe, are tools to reach other people and engage with them in unique ways; for me, art is the mean that allows us to know about ourselves and others, and a true universal language that shortens distances and strenghtens bonds. More than anything else, my future goal is to be able to put myself out there as a complete artist, and seek both personal and communitary <b>evolution</b> with each new step taken.</p>
