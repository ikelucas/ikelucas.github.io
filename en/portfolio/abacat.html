				<p><b>Link:</b> <span class="infonao">Not available</span><br><b>Genre:</b> <i>Adventure and Comedy Cartoon</i><br><b>Summary:</b> <i>Abacat is a cartoon series whose main star is a kitten with the same name, insecure and introspective because they have an exotic look that makes them look like a fruit. The story begins with the cat moving to a new school, where they believe they will be looked down upon because of their unique appearance. The series follows Abacat through situations that are common during the teenage years, using their special shape as a hook to talk about each own's individuality, and how it's possible to balance our similarities and differences so that we can enjoy our time with people that are special to us without leaving behind the essence that is within us.</i></p>
